# Attitude-Kinematics

Matlab code to estimate Euler Angles based on angular acceleration measurements collected in the body-fixed axis system. Estimate the rate of change in the euler angles using inertial navigation system mechanization equations. The Runge-Kutta 4 method was then used to integrate and estimate the rate of change of the Euler Angles given the initial yaw, pitch, and roll.
